This is a Minecraft plugin that rewards the player for getting an achievement. When the player receives an achievement, a chest will spawn in front of them that contains a variety of different items.
However, if the player were to be in a cave, or in front of a block, the chest would have nowhere to spawn, therefore, I also included a /claim command, which allows the user to click whether they want to claim the chest at a different time.
This project taught me how to use clickable messages in minecraft, along with how to handle variables that change globally (object oriented programming).

Synopsis of what the plugin can do:

* Listen for when the player receives an achievement
* Spawn a chest with items in front of them
* If block in front of player, player receives a claim
* Player can claim the claim any time they want, which opens a chest GUI of the items they would've received before
* The chest will have random items

I have no intention of finishing this project, so some logic, especially regarding the rarity of chests and the different items you can get, may be off/wrong.
